NFT Landing Page

This was the only project that was more challenging as I was expecting. The look of the page is very dynamic and majorly used of different different colors, mostly gradient. It took me more than 15 hours to complete this project. Many new things I learned while developing this project. The experience was very nice of developing this project.
